# Dante

This project was a 3 weeks project in C. I did it with Florian Autour.
This project has a maze generator and a maze solver.
The generator is a house made algorythme and the solver is a Depth First Search solver.
To try the generator, use make and then ./generator/genrator x_size y_size.
To try the solver, use make and then ./solver/solver maze_name or make bonus_run and ./bonus/solver_bonus maze_name to have some color.
